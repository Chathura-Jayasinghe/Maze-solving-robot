# Maze-solving-robot

This project presents a **maze-solving robot** developed by **Group 4** as part of our coursework. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate through a maze by detecting paths, avoiding obstacles, and finding the optimal route to the destination.

The implementation focuses on:

* **Sensor integration** for line detection and obstacle avoidance.
* **Microcontroller programming** to execute decision-making algorithms.
* **Efficient pathfinding techniques** to minimize traversal time.
* **Robust mechanical design** for smooth and accurate movement.

Through this project, we aimed to enhance our knowledge of embedded systems, robotics, and algorithm design while working collaboratively as a team.
